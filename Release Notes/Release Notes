#Release Notes#

*Release 3.1*
Alt App Store and Mios will now be kept in sync with release numbering and use a common code base.
This release fixes a problem introduced by google as well as adding small non-functional changes
so that the vera code and the openluup code are the same. In addition the test calendar and credentials are install
on first use to enable easy verification that the plugin is working.

*Release 3.0*
Has been removed as it is non-functional due to changes made by google.
This is functionally the same as release 2.5 documented here:
